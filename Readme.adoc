I started this project by creating a folder for my screens and a folder for the other components.

The first page I want to be seen is the startGameScreen, so I add it to my App.js

Then I add some styling to the startGameScreen.

In the startGameScreen I need some buttons, so I make this component and insert it to de startGameScreen.
I don't take standard buttons, so I look for Github react native, where I find the source code.
In Libraries, Components, Button.js, and I use it in my code.
