I started this project by creating a folder for my screens and a folder for the other components.

The first page I want to be seen is the startGameScreen, so I add it to my App.js

Then I add some styling to the startGameScreen.

In the startGameScreen I need some buttons, so I make this component and insert it to de startGameScreen.
I don't take standard buttons, so I look for Github react native, where I find the source code.
In Libraries, Components, Button.js, and I use it in my code.

By using 'Pressable', the color of the button changes when pressing on them.
And by adding some styles I can change the lay-out as wanted.

For the background I use a LinearGradient and I download a picture, which I can use as background image.
By adapting the picture's opacity, I can make a nice background.

When the entered number is smaller than 0, or bigger than 99, I show an alert.
By importing Alert from React-Native and giving it a title, a message, a text to confirm and an eventHandler.

To be able to use a certain layout multiple times, I made a separate component for a title.
I can then use this component several times, as desired.
