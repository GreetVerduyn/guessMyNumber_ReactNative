I started this project by creating a folder for my screens and a folder for the other components.

When I look for Github react native, I find the source code.
In Libraries, Components, Button.js I find a return, so I use it in my code as well.

The first page I want to be seen is the startGameScreen, so I add it to my App.js

Then I add some styling to the startGameScreen.
